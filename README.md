## Blockchain Architecture​
```
IPFS approach will be used for storing documents ​

Documents will be converted to a hash with SHA-256 before uploads and a self-executing smart contract with the hash will be deployed on the blockchain​

The blockchain will then check if the document sets off any flags for plagiarism in a proactive manner​

Once verified and added to the blockchain, the actual document will be stored on a decentralized storage solution (IPFS)​

Documents can be retrieved by anyone with access rights by using the hash in the smart contract ​
